            "However, I knew that it wasn't what I really wanted to do, not in the entirety of my career.",

            "So I went through some diffult times trying to figure out how to do the simpliest commands just to print out a 5x5 # grid on the console.",
            `Lucky for me, I found out that many people recommended a course named "CS50X" provided by Harvard University, and it was precisely because of this course that my coding journey finally began.`,
            "Moreover, thanks to this course, the complex programming logics and theories suddenly became more comprehensible for me and through the completion of their difficult problem sets (especially Tideman) I learnt not only how to code in C or Python but also how to learn a new programming language, and this is the most important thing one can take from this course."

            "Watching Netflix is also my favourite thing to do, Korean dramas and historical documentaries are my favourite genres.",
            `Apart from that, reading is my other hobby. My favourite books are "Guns, Germs and Steel" written by Jared Diamond, "The Origins of the Modern World" written by Robert Marks and "The Great Divergence" written by Kenneth Pomeranz.`
